# Cryptoblocker

A chrome extension to dynamically block cryptocurrency miners.

It consists of a blacklist of known miner script sources, as well as dynamic resource consumption based heuristic checks to detect other mining scripts.

The blacklist is sourced from https://zerodot1.gitlab.io/CoinBlockerListsWeb/index.html?fbclid=IwAR2n5RQnmhtHcWXt0gN-H8UfYrcyNjHKHPma3llFlRZV55FNdk1NLfbSvb4

# Installation

Cryptoblocker requires the Google Chrome Dev Channel, which can be downloaded from https://www.google.com/chrome/dev/?platform=win64.
Once that has been done, clone the repo then add the extension to Google Chrome Dev. This can be done by visiting chrome://extensions , turning on developer mode, then loading an unpacked extension. Simply navigate to the git repo and load.
